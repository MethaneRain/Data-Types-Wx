# Data-Types-Wx
### Reference for working with various Wx data types in Python specifically

## Since I have spent most of my time dealing with weather data in Python, this repository will highlight basic data access via Python for data files:
  * netCDF (.nc) - most common
  * Gribs (.grib or .grib2) - most common
  * HDF5 (.hdf)
  * Fits (.fits) - Hubble Telescope Data


## netCDF
One of the most common data file types for working with weather/atmospheric data is the .nc files
 - GOES data usually is packaged in this format
 - Some model data also is in this format

## Gribs
 - Most GFS and other models are in this format initially

## HDF5
 - A lot of other satellite data (MSG, etc) are origianlly in this format
